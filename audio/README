Example talk from cppcon:
- Mean duration of silence: 0.3194 compared to 0.3581,
  You are probably talking too long without breaking, there's no enough gap between sentences
  for the audience to digest your content!
- Unique number of words: 329 compared to 374
- Unique number of words divided by total number of words: 0.2686 compared to 0.2494
 Doing good, you are using appropriate number of vocabularies so that the audience won't feel bored
- Number of words per second: 5.002 compared to 4.6267, you're probably talking a little too fast
